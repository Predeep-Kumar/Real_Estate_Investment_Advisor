However, the natural market volatility and spatial heterogeneities together with the lack of advanced analytical tools creates a barrier in the ability of investors to determine the long-term returns. The proposed project titled the Real Estate Investment Advisor aims to fill this gap by creating a machine-learning-based application that is capable of interpreting the characteristics of the properties, predicting the future value, and identifying the promising investments. The system is able to generate a comprehensive decision-support application customised on real estate investors, purchasers, and industry stakeholders through synergising data analytics, predictive modelling, and interactive visualisation.\n","\n","The general epigraph of the project is dichotomous. First of all, a classification model outlines properties as either Good Investment or Not a Good Investment, which is based on engineered properties (price per square foot, locality-based median pricing, property age, accessibility indices, and amenity variables). Secondly, using the current price, city-related appreciation rates, infrastructure indicators, and inherent property attributes, a regression model is used to forecast the expected price of the property in five years. The combination of these models allows investors to evaluate the qualitative, as well as the potential quantitative, merits of a property before committing to it.\n","\n","The endeavour begins with data conditioning, which includes handling of missing values, removal of duplicates, outliers adjustment, coding of categorical variables and normalisation of numeric attributes. The domain-generated features such as price per square foot, school density index, transport accessibility score, and deviation against the median of the locality are designed to reflect the patterns of interest to investors. An artificial binary target variable, Good Investment is modeled by using the price competitiveness, property attributes and the price heuristics of appreciation.\n","\n","The understanding of the market dynamics is based on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The investigation uses visualisations and descriptive statistics to investigate location-specific price patterns, size to price relationships, property typology distributions, and the effects of amenities and accessibility on valuations. The correlational analyses determine those features that have the strongest effect on the investment potential and future value, which determines further modelling choices.\n","\n","Two different machine-learning pipelines are then designed, one that is based on classification and the other regression-based. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms are checked on classification activities and Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor are analysed on price prediction. The measures of model efficacy are assessed by Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC on classification, and RMSE, MAE, and R 2 on regression. The use of MLflow is to catalogue experiments, compare performance metrics, record hyperparameters and store model artefacts therefore imparting reproducibility and version control.\n","\n","The final structure is implemented as an application of Streamlit associated with users. Upon end-user input of property specifications, such as geographic coordinates, spatial sizes, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, amenity profile, and the current price, the interface generates the classification of the investment, predicts the five-year price and displays the confidence scores alongside visual representation (geospatial heatmaps, time series trend plots, etc.). This is an interactive portal that democratises advanced analytics among audiences who do not possess technical skills.\n","\n","Overall, the Real Estate Investment Advisor transformed the unprocessed housing data into a convenient tool of investment advice. The project demonstrates the potential of data-driven decision support in the property industry through providing investors with reliable information, automated assessment of properties to real-estate businesses, and helping to resolve the issue of opacities during the acquisition process."],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Provide your GitHub Link here.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Develop a machine learning application to assist potential investors in making real estate decisions.
